DOG-HUB

Dog Breeds SPA

DOG-HUB is a React SPA, that allows users to search for their favorite dog breeds, view detailed information about each breed, and perform various sorting and filtering options. Additionally, it provides functionality for users to create and add new dog breeds. 

When a user enters the app, they are presented with a search bar where they can enter the name of a specific dog breed. As they start typing, the app dynamically fetches and displays relevant breed suggestions, helping users find the desired breed quickly. Once a breed is selected, the app retrieves and displays detailed information about the breed, including characteristics, temperament, size, and origin.

One unique feature of the app is the ability to create and add new dog breeds. Users can access a form where they can provide information about a new breed, such as name, characteristics, temperament, and other relevant details. Once submitted, the app securely processes the information and adds the newly created breed to the database. This feature allows users to contribute to the app's collection of dog breeds and share their knowledge with others.

Technologies used:
